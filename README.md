# Seam Carving (Python)

**Description:**

This is a web app that uses the seam carving algorithm to resize an uploaded image using seam carving. Seam Carving works by finding and removing seams in the image that pass through the least important pixels. Here is an example.


| ![](Test_file_horse/400x250.png) | ![](Test_file_horse/200x200.jpg) |
| ------ | ------ |
| Original: 400x250 | Resized: 200x200 | |

_**Note:** The program only implements shrinking the dimensions of an image._
